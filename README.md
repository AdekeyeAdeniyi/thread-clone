## 1. Introduction

This Fullstack Thread Clone Application is a web-based platform that allows users to create and participate in threaded discussions, similar to popular forum websites. It utilizes modern web development technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (Make sure it's running)
- Git
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- API Keys (if needed, e.g., Clerk, Webhook)

## 3. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Thread Clone Application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd thread-clone-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
     npm install
   ```
3. Start application
   ```bash
     npm run start
   ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000 to access the application.

## 4. Project Structure

The project is structured into two main architecture: `server` and `client`.

- `server`: Contains the server-side code using Next.js 13, MongoDB, and other server-side technologies.

- `client`: Contains the client-side code using React, Tailwind CSS, and other front-end technologies.
